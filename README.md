# What is that

This is an example of an issue I am experiencing when trying to migrate tests from XCTest to Swift Testing.

The environment:

* Xcode 16 beta 4
* Swift 6 that comes with the Xcode
* Swift Testing framework that comes with the Xcode

You will find the traditional XCTest suite in `XCTestSuite.swift` and Swift Testing Suite in `SwiftTestingSuite.swift`.

I ran all the tests from Xcode.
